1. Open the app
2. Tap "+1 Glass" button 8+ times to reach daily goal
3. Sprite should be in ðŸŒŸ thriving state
4. Take screenshot showing full screen

#### Screenshot 2: Happy Sprite (Good Progress)
1. Reset the app or start fresh day
2. Tap "+1 Glass" button 6-7 times
3. Sprite should be in ðŸ˜Š happy state
4. Take screenshot

#### Screenshot 3: Water Logging Action
1. With sprite in any state, hover finger over "+1 Glass" button
2. Take screenshot showing the interactive buttons clearly
3. Make sure UI elements are visible and clean

#### Screenshot 4: Progress Tracking
1. Ensure you have some water logged (3-5 glasses)
2. Make sure daily goal progress is visible
3. Take screenshot showing progress indicators

#### Screenshot 5: Dehydrated State (Contrast)
1. Reset app or start with 0 water logged
2. Sprite should be in ðŸ˜µ dehydrated state
3. Take screenshot to show the "before" state

### Step 3: Capture Screenshots

# Connect device and ensure it's detected
adb devices

# Take screenshot using ADB
adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/screenshot1.png
adb pull /sdcard/screenshot1.png play-store-assets/screenshots/

# Repeat for each screenshot with different filenames
```

#### Method 2: Device Built-in Screenshot
1. **Android**: Power + Volume Down (simultaneously)
2. **iOS**: Side Button + Volume Up (or Home + Power on older devices)
3. Transfer screenshots to computer
4. Copy to `play-store-assets/screenshots/` folder

#### Method 3: Android Studio (If using emulator)
1. Open Android Studio
2. Run app on emulator
3. Click camera icon in emulator controls
4. Save screenshots to `play-store-assets/screenshots/`

### Step 4: Organize Screenshots
```bash
# Rename screenshots descriptively
cd play-store-assets/screenshots/

# Example naming convention:
# 01-thriving-sprite-goal-reached.png
# 02-happy-sprite-good-progress.png
# 03-water-logging-buttons.png
# 04-progress-tracking.png
# 05-dehydrated-sprite-contrast.png
```
